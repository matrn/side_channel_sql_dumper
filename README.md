Get letter by letter from login form using SQL injection
=========

This code is just experiment for getting words from SQL database using injectable login form (this login form can't exists in real world) and reading word character by character using try/fail method - different responses from server = blind SQL injection. It's also possible to use timing attack but in this case this type of attack is faster.
